```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is Matt's landing page, and it's pretty dope.

## Including Code

Apparently I can include R code in here, like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

I've been told that I can also embed plots:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

... But that didn't seem to work. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
